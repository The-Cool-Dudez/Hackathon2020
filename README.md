Project 3 - Eventful Technologies

DESCRIPTION: 

Eventful Technologies: At running and other endurance events around the globe professional photographers are used to snap race photos. These photographers bring their own cameras and then provide the photos to the organizer. As a participant it can take days to get your race photos, and often they are expensive. ET needs help developing pieces for their real-time photo delivery system, pieces include:

i. Development of an Android/iOS app which can interact with a wireless device embedded in cameras to grab, manipulate, tag (with metadata), and upload photos in real time.

ii. Development of cloud based photo processing engine to accept photos, load metadata into a database, and store photos.

iii. Development of a REST API which will allow internal or 3rd party tools to query available images for distribution.
